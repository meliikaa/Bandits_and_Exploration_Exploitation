## Introduction

Reinforcement learning is a subfield of machine learning where an agent learns to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards over time. This repository focuses on different strategies used by agents to balance exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing actions with high expected rewards).

## Agents

### Greedy Agent

The Greedy Agent is a basic reinforcement learning agent that always chooses the action with the highest estimated Q-value (expected sum of future rewards) in a given state. While this strategy is exploitative, it might not explore alternative actions, leading to suboptimal solutions.

### Epsilon-Greedy Agent

The Epsilon-Greedy Agent is an extension of the Greedy Agent that introduces exploration through a strategy called epsilon-greedy. With a certain probability epsilon, the agent explores by choosing a random action, and with a probability of 1 - epsilon, it exploits its current knowledge by selecting the action with the highest Q-value.

### Epsilon-Greedy Agent with Constant Step Size

This variant of the Epsilon-Greedy Agent uses a constant step size to update Q-values. The step size remains the same throughout the learning process, allowing the agent to adapt to rewards at a constant rate.
